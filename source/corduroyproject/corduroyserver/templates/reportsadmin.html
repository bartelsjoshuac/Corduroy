    <h1>Approve/Edit/Approve Grooming Report</h1>

    This is not yet implemented as it requires some more thought.
    I need to build a form from the trails view where the approvalstatus is false.
    Then from the form I build, update the record

    Also still need to add in auth for groomers and admins

    And build test cases

    <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 72px;" border="1">

        <tr>
            <td><strong> Name</strong></td> <td><strong>Trail Rating</strong></strong></td> <td><b><strong>Trail Location</strong></td>
        </tr>      
    {% for trail in trails %}
        <tr>
            <td>{{ trail.trailName }} </td> <td>{{ trail.rating }}</td> <td>{{ trail.location }} </td>
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
    
    </table>
