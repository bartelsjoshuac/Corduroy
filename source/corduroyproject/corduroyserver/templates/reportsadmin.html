    <h1>Approve/Edit/Approve Grooming Report</h1>

    This is not yet implemented as it requires some more thought.
    I need to build a form from the trails view where the approvalstatus is false.
    Then from the form I build, update the record

    Also still need to add in auth for groomers and admins

    And build test cases
