This is my attempt at some throwback HTML, circa 1997, AKA an animated "Under Construction" GIF of a little man with a saw and a sign.  I guess 25 years later we call these GIPHY's or something.  As it turns out Alpine lets you
animate any image without storing a bunch of GIFs in GIF, you can just tell it to move the GIF.

Yes, it is distracting as ever and only meets the authentically pleasing requirement if it were still 1997.

The sled will stop if you click on it, but since I don't provide that information likely most people will have to live with the sled moving all the time which is well, distracting at best.  It will also start moving again
on its own after a long time, as if the day changes or something I never figured out. 

With the <blink> tag depreciated, it was the best I could do.  Maybe people will thinking the moving sled indicates that the page is waiting for new approved reports to appear, as that was the original idea behind it...
to make the homepage auto-refresh if a new report appeared.  I started to implement this and it went badly, was not part of the original use cases and well I ripped it out....  

But the moving sled made the final cut for the reasons above.
