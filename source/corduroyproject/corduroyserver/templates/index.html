<br>Recent Updates:
<li>Added CSS for mobile and dark look</li>
<li>Added sled image since I can't seem to get other things working/li>
<li> Report admin approval is working except not generating the success page</li>

Current Limitations:
<li>I would like to incoorperate the trials list into the index.html, which means the index would be a template of the reports view, filtered to approved?</li>
    <li> Need primary foreign key relationship, similiar to what I missed in the dog/breed view exercise< but it is not working so switched it back but this is not working with postgres/li>
<li>Authentication for admin functions not working so I disabled it</li>
<li>Complete test cases AND CI when I get the other three functionalies working</li>
